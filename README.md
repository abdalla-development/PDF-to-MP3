# PDF-to-MP3
Portfolio
    • The project is divided into two main parts in order for it to work, the first part was to be able to open and read the PDF file and obtain the text that it contains, and the second part was to convert that text into audio file or mp3 file. 
    • The second part was somehow hard in terms of finding a free API for developers that you would make a request along with passing the text as parameters and get the audio file as a response, but I was not able to find such API all the ones I found they require at least the providing of a credit card information to use it even as free and badly I don’t have one, so I had resorted to using gtts python module.
    • The easy part of the project was getting the text as well as converting it to mp3 but the longer the pages or the file size in general the more time it will take to convert the text to audio.
    • Improvement will be by adding a file browser to allow the user to select the file he wants to convert or even an input field to enter the file path.
